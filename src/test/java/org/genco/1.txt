It’s the year 2001 and let’s say you’re at a lecture, meeting, or even the movies. You are engrossed in the environment when all of a sudden your concentration is broken as you hear the first dozen notes from Michael Jackson’s Thriller. Someone in the room yourself included) has forgotten to turn off their cell phone. This situation is an annoyance that has happened to almost everyone. Now imagine that it is the year 2051 and you’re at a lecture, meeting or the movies. The high-pitched, and yet familiar ditty that you hear might not be the result of a person forgetting to switch off their cell phone. Instead, the person might have forgotten to switch off their implant.

This future scenario is not my latest screenplay idea, but rather a scientific possibility. According to Newsweek, some researchers state that in 50 years cyborgs will be possible. In the traditional sense, cyborgs are humans with electrical and mechanical devices grafted into their biological systems. This definition is rapidly changing as the boundaries and limits of technology grow. The line in the sand dividing man and machine is less apparent than it once was.

There is a popular saying that someday people will have bar codes engraved onto their foreheads. Someday might not be that far away if current trends in the cybernetic field continue. Kevin Warwick, a professor in the department of cybernetics at the University of Reading, England, made a major stride in cyborg technology in 1998. Warwick became the test subject of his own experiment when he had a silicon chip surgically implanted in his left arm. The experiment was designed to test whether or not the chip could communicate with an outside computer. What made the experiment so dangerous was that the glass tube that held the chip might have broken, which would have almost surely killed Warwick.
